Three years ago Transloadit was ready to replace their jQuery based file uploading & processing plugin for browsers with something more modern. They posted a [job ad](https://transloadit.com/jobs/2015-10-front-end-developer/) in search for people to build it:

> In general we're looking for polished, well tested, carefully crafted products that are delightful to work with and use. So for this job it's not only important that you know JavaScript, but also how to make things look stunning and work well for end users.
>
> At your disposal are time, focus, and the core team ready to provide feedback, guidance, and anything else you need.

Initially the idea was to build a proprietary uploader that would work exclusively with Transloadit’s commercial service. But we quickly turned around on it: we knew this could have a real impact. So, just like we did with Tus, we decided to make Uppy an open source solution for everybody to use and hack. Transloadit support became an optional plugin.

Three years, [16.000 stargazers](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers) and a thriving community later — and we could not be happier to launch Uppy 1.0.

## Why was Uppy built

We sometimes get asked why you'd even need anything beyond `<input type="file">`, why bring JS into this. The truth is: for many cases `<input type="file">` is fine.

Sometimes, however, you’d like to add a nice drag and drop surface with file previews and upload progress. Webcam support might be useful. Picking files from your Instagram and Dropbox without hitting mobile phones can save a lot of bandwidth and battery life (uploads with Uppy and Companion happen server-to-server).

For large files, resumability is essential: like surviving wifi hiccups or accidental navigate aways, not having to start the upload from scratch.

All those things can significantly improve the user experience when uploading is a central aspect of your web/app. And Uppy can be deployed with nothing but a JS tag, using an existing `<form>` for fallback, and your Apache/Nginx server.

## Uppy history and the team

The Uppy team first consisted of [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Harry](https://github.com/hedgerh). Artur moved to New York for a while, while most of the team was based in Europe, so we’ve been enjoying some early (and late) calls with significant time differences.

Artur was mostly working on the frontend and building what is known today as the [Dashboard](/examples/dashboard/) — the full-featured most commonly used Uppy plugin. Harry took on the first version of what was then called Uppy Server (now Companion) — responsible for picking files from Google Drive, Instagram, remote Urls, etc.

Transloadit team had a meetup in Amsterdam, where Artur was [present](https://mobile.twitter.com/arturi/status/701394760796229632) in an unusual way (in the center):

Then [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) joined the team and took over Companion work.

Building all these features properly took a lot of time, and two years after landing the project at Transloadit, I was [writing a job ad post myself](https://transloadit.com/jobs/2017-02-open-source-frontend-dev/) as Uppy took serious proportions. That’s where [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) joined the team (funny story — we met through collaboration on GitHub on Choo and Yo-Yo libraries), helping with Uppy React components, Redux integration, Golden Retriever plugin and many more cool features.

[Alex](https://zaytsev.io/) joined in to advice us on the UI design.

A year later the team had another meeting in Berlin, where we worked on the [Golden Retriever](/docs/golden-retriever/) plugin that helps recover files from browser crashes. We also played Mario Kart (I lost, despite all the practice!) and dressed as characters from the game:

Read more [about Golden Retriever and that team meetup](https://uppy.io/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/). Golden Retriever got good press on Reddit and Hacker News because it goes above and beyond to make things absurdly reliable. In the demo video you see us `kill -9` our browser, restart, and the upload just picks right up where it left off. A first!

## The 30 days challenge

We’ve been posponing the 1.0 release for quite some time. There’s always just one more feature or another bug you want to fix, before calling at a 1.0. Truth be told, Uppy has been [used in production](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#used-by) for a while already, and even though we iterate and change things frequently, the API had mostly stabilized.

So we’ve decided to pull the trigger and [announced an Uppy Month](https://uppy.io/blog/2019/03/liftoff-01/) inside Transloadit, where all team members, including those not working primarily on Uppy — the tus core team, our SDK teams, as well as our infra & API engineers, designers, content writers, and the founders themselves — all be chipped in and did their part to ensure liftoff in thirty days. We also asked [Evgenia](http://github.com/lakesare) to join us for the month to land a hand with frontend work. Every week we had a call where we looked at the Asana Uppy 1.0 project board and talked about our progress.

Here are some highlights on what we’ve managed to deliver in the Uppy Month:

- A new Uppy website design
- [Localization support and language packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443) for Russian, German, Dutch and French (more coming from the community). Kevin and Artur wrote a script that loops through all Uppy plugins in the repo and generates one canonical `en_US` that can be used as a basis for other translations. The script even checks for missing strings accross all translations, so you know which ones to update.
- [Improved Drag and Drop in the Dashboard](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440), being an important part of Uppy, has been significantly improved with support for pasting files and links from both the browser and the device (so you can, say, drag a link or an image from a different tab to Uppy).
- [Basic React Native support (Beta)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) — Uppy runs in React Native environment, we have an example with resumable uploads via tus, and `@uppy/react-native` Expo component support picking images, videos, documents and files from remote Urls with Companion.
- [Design facelift](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1442) — the Dashboard UI has been significantly improved in the past days: new icons, typography polishing, better color organization, enlarged clickable areas and more.
- Many accessibility issues uncovered
- [Robodog gained support for an inline Dashboard](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1450).
- [Documentation structure has been reworked](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405).
- [Transloadit Assemblies can now be properly canceled](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1431).
- [Upload progress is reported more accurately with xhr-upload and Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1454).
- [Upload progress improved in general](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1376).
- [npm scripts have been refactored](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1392) — yes, important!
- Craziest of all: our content team has been on a roll and [released a post *every day*](https://uppy.io/blog/2019/03/liftoff-01/) for the past 30 days to keep you updated on our day-to-day progress.

## So what features did we end up delivering on?

- Lightweight / easy on dependencies
- Small core, modular architecture. Everything is a plugin
- Uses modern JavaScript with transpiled ES5 versions available in `lib`, and minified versions for direct use by browsers in `dist`
- Usable as a bundle straight from a CDN, as well as a module to import
- Resumable file uploads via the open tus standard
- Robust: retries for all-the-things, avoid showing ‘weird errors’
- Locale support: easily switch languages or supply your own copy
- Compatible with React (React Native in beta)
- Works great on mobile
- Works great with Transloadit. Works great without

We also left two features "behind":

> Offering sugared shortcuts for novice users (presets) 

We felt Uppy is straightforward enough to use, presets could end up making this less clear. Robodog does offer less boilerplatey integrations, but this was done as a wrapper instead of a preset.

> Themable UI with a beautiful default 

Instead of going for `{ theme: 'dark' }`, we only offer theming via CSS. It is of course very feasible to create a `dark.css` file, and maybe we can come up with a section on the site for easily sharing and distributing such files, but we let go of this desire for 1.0.

We also did not ship Google Photos or Box support, we hope these are things that the community can help with. So while we didn't tick all the boxes, for a 3 year gameplan, we are very happy with this result.

## What’s next for Uppy?

Does this mean Uppy is perfect? Nope! There are [issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues), items in our backlog, and we are already [planning Uppy 1.1](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#11). We want to release a WordPress plugin, add image cropping, and more, but we are releasing 1.0 today because it contains the features that we set out to implement. They are all documented and we don't expect their APIs to change. And if they do, that will have to be handled with care, for instance by shipping a 2.0 and making all the noise that comes with that. Uppy has seen serious usage by a seriously large community and by various serious enterprises, and with 1.0 we're now also signaling to you: Hey, we take it serious and we won't be swapping things from underneath your app just like that. And if you don't have Uppy powering your file uploads yet, now is the best time to give it a shot.
